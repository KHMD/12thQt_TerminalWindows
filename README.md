# 12thQt_TerminalWindows
Project done as the 12th grade final CS Project by Gautam Padiyar and Aditya Venkatraman

We built a beginner friendly bash terminal that worked natively on Windows. The basic directory commands, some file manipulation commands and the entire ‘man’ pages were available to the user. 
The GUI folder has a fully working secondary window that was meant to serve as a tutorial with basic instructions for a linux beginner.

####The commands available were
- cd 
- cat
- echo
- grep
- ls
- mkdir
- pwd
- rm
- touch
- man

####Please Note:

1. Some directory paths are hard coded due to time constraint and un-familiarity with the system it was intended to be run on during final presentation
2. No further development will be done on this project. Pull requests will not be accepted.
