# 12thQt_TerminalWindows
Project done as the 12th grade final CS Project.

The project is a half decent emulation of the linux terminal that works natively on Windows. Basic commands work fine.
The GUI folder has a fully working secondary window that was meant to serve as a tutorial with basic instructions for a linux beginner.

Please Note:

1. A lot of stuff is hardcoded (directory links) due to time constraint and un-familiarity with the system it was intended to be run on during presentation
2. No further development will be done on this project.
